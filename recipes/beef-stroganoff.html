       <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>Oh, Beef Stroganoff—the ultimate comfort food! To make it, we sauté tender strips of beef and mushrooms in butter, then swirl with sour cream to make a creamy sauce, and serve over noodles, rice, or fries.</p>
      <p>You will want to make stroganoff with a tender cut of beef, such as tenderloin or top sirloin. For a quick version, you can use ground beef instead of beef strips.It's not particularly fussy, the bulk of the prep time comes from slicing the beef and mushrooms.</p>

      <p>According to Food Timeline, Beef Stroganoff may have first appeared in Russian cookbooks in the mid 1800s, presumably named for a prominent member of the Stroganoff family.</p>

      <p>The dish became popular in the U.S. in the 1950s from servicemen returning from Europe and China after WWII.</p>
