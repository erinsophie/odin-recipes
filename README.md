# odin-recipes
This is my first project on The Odin Project!

The idea is to create a website that consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes. 

Here, I have combined various elements of what I have learned so far, including:

- Using the command line to create all of the files and directories for this project
- Using Git to write commit messages
- Using GitHub to publish the project
- Practicing the basics of HTML
